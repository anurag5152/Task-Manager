# Task-Manager
#Overview:
Task Manager is a web-based application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application features an interactive and user-friendly interface with a purplish theme. The Task Manager allows users to add, edit, delete, and organize tasks with ease. Each task includes a title, description, due date, and priority level, which can be updated as needed. The tasks are divided into three categories on the dashboard: Upcoming Tasks, Overdue Tasks, and Completed Tasks, making it simple to keep track of different task statuses at a glance.

#Setup Instructions:
1) Download the Repository
2) Navigate to the Project Directory
Open the project folder where the files are located.
3) Right-click on index.html and open it in your preferred browser.
4) Now we can use the Task Manager.

#Additional Information:
Tasks are saved locally in the browser's localStorage, meaning that data will persist across sessions. However, this data is specific to the browser and device you use, so clearing your browser’s cache will also erase saved tasks. And I just did what i was intructed to do.
